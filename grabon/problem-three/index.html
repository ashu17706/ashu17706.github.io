    <h2>Problem 3</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I have gone through <a href="http://www.grabon.in">grabon.in</a> to analyze the latency issue.
      My findings are as below

      <ul>
        <li>
          Higher no of request to the http://cdn.lmitassets.com, responsible for higher Queying time for resources (As 6 connection can be there with one domain at a time) and leading to higher total page load time.
          As a suggestion I think we can move these images to different cdn domains to split the load. (If image sprites techniques is not being used because of some reason).
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilizing HTTPS will make Grabon more secure and future proof(moving to SPDY will be easy).
        </li>
        <li>
          For better mobile experiance we can have offline support with service worker, add to home screen popup and splash screen. Which give faster User Interaction. (Not directly related to latency but faster though but better UX).
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>

    <code>Team GrabOn has done an awesome work for Performance Optimiation. <i>First meaningful paint: <b>1797.4ms</b> (target: 1600ms) is pretty fast. As well as the Estimated Input Latency: <b>21.7ms</b> (target: 50ms)</i> shows the hard work done.</code>
